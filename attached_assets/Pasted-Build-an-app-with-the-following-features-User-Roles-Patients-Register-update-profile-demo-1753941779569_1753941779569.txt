Build an app with the following features:

User Roles:

Patients: Register, update profile (demographics, diagnosis, blood group, transfusion history, iron chelation therapy, upcoming transfusion date), view assigned donor “family,” track transfusion/ICT adherence, and sync health data (Apple Health, Google Fit on Android or custom form).

Donors: Register, specify blood group and location, view upcoming donation slots, get automated reminders (every 3–4 months), see personal donation log/history, and receive incentive badges.

Healthcare Providers: Approve/monitor transfusion records, verify donor eligibility, communicate securely with patients.

Donor Family Assignment:

Assign 18–20 donors (“family”) to each patient based on location and blood group, using data from the e-RaktKosh API for donor pool optimization.

Donors notified well in advance (3–5 days) of the patient’s next scheduled transfusion—track available vs. required blood units.

If predicted supply falls short, send urgent notifications to remaining family and escalate to a wider network if needed.

Monitoring & Reminders:

Predict and track transfusion frequency per patient, using AI/ML based on transfusion records, hemoglobin trends, and clinical factors.

Reminders for ICT (iron chelation therapy), health checkups, and donations.

Integration: iOS Health app (Apple HealthKit), Android via Google Fit.

Engagement & Education:

Incentive badges, milestone notifications for recurring donors.

In-app educational content for patients, families, and donors.

Optional peer-support, FAQ/chatbot, anonymous donor–patient feedback.

Backend:

Use Supabase for authentication, secure user management, role-based access control, and to store all user, donor, and transfusion data.

Ensure all data sharing is strictly permissions-based, with encryption and audit logs.

Emergency/Backup Features:

Real-time “urgent call” notifications to local blood banks or nearby donors if family pool is insufficient.

Camp/drive locator—integrate and display upcoming blood camps (from e-RaktKosh API if available).
