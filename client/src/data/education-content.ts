        • Alpha Thalassemia: Caused by reduced or absent alpha globin chains
        • Beta Thalassemia: Caused by reduced or absent beta globin chains
        
        The severity ranges from mild (thalassemia minor/trait) to severe (thalassemia major).`

        When to start:
        • Usually after 10-20 transfusions

        How it's managed:
        • Daily oral medications (Deferasirox, Deferiprone)
